1. Data Loading: We load the music ratings dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. User-Item Matrix Creation: We create a matrix where the rows represent users, the columns represent songs, and the cell values represent the user's rating for the song.
3. KNN Model Creation: We create a KNN model with 5 neighbors and use the cosine similarity metric to measure the similarity between users.
4. Recommendation Function: We define a function get_recommendations that takes a user ID and the number of recommendations as input. It retrieves the user's ratings, gets the KNN recommendations, and returns the recommended song IDs.
5. Testing the Recommendation Function: We test the recommendation function with a sample user ID and print the recommended songs.

This is a basic music recommendation system using KNN. You can improve it by using more advanced algorithms, incorporating additional data (e.g., song genres, user demographics), and optimizing the model for betterÂ performance.
